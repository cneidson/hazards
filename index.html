        <h1>Storm Risk and Environmental Hazards in NYC</h1>
        <p>
          New York City is vulnerable to coastal storms, including nor'easters,
          tropical storms and hurricanes. Residents living in floodprone areas face
          risks not only from coastal storms themselves, but also from long-term
          environmental and public health hazards associated with flooding in these
          areas. Much of this is linked to the long history of
          manufacturing and industrial enterprises in New York.</p>
          <p>These risks will be explored in this map.</p>

        <h2>What are evacuation zones?</h2>
        <p>As part of its diaster managment planning, New York City has
          designated six hurricane evacuation zones to identify areas likely to
          be inundated by storm surge. In the event of a hurricane or tropical
          storm, residents in the hurricane zones may be ordered to evacuate.</p>
        <p>There are six levels of evacuation zones. <b>Zone 1</b>
           has the highest risk and is the most likely to flood.</p>
        <p>These zones were unveiled by the city in 2013 to expand on older hurricane evacuation zones and help the
          city better communicate with affected communities. The revised zones drew in
          <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/map-nyc-has-new-hurricane-evacuation-zones" target="_blank">an additional 600,000 New Yorkers</a>
          not included within the boundaries of the former zones.</p>

        <h2>What is the impact of storm flooding?</h2>
        <p>For many New Yokers, the city's storm vulnerability was made very
          apparent when Hurricane Sandy hit the city on October 29, 2012. The
          storm resulted in 44 deaths, and an estimated <a
          href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cdbgdr/about/About%20Hurricane%20Sandy.page" target="_blank">$19
          billion in damages and economic loses</a>.
          More than 69,000 residential unit were damaged, and thousands of residents were temporarily displaced.</p>
        <p>One of the communities that was hardest hit.</p>

        <h2>Significant Maritime and Industrial Areas (SMIAs)</h2>
        <p>In order to help preserve the maritime industry and water dependent industry uses that still exist, the Plan also designates 6 areas as Significant Maritime Industrial Areas (SMIA).</p>
        <p> These districts were previously zoned for heavy manufacturing and will continue to be used for industry. The designated SMIAâ€™s include:</br>
          Kill Van Kull between Staten Island and Bayonne</br>
          Sunset Park in Brooklyn</br>
          Red Hook in Brooklyn</br>
          Brooklyn Navy Yard in Brooklyn</br>
          Newtown Creek in Brooklyn and Queens</br>
          South Bronx in the Bronx</br></p>
